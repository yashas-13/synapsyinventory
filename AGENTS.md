## Core System components

The SCM system is built around a collection of specialized software components. Each component is a distinct component with its own set of responsibilities, designed to automate specific tasks and communicate with other components to create an integrated and intelligent system.

### 1. **distributors**
This component serves as the primary interface for the Arivu Foods administrator, providing centralized control and a high-level overview of the entire supply chain.

**Key Features:**
-   **Master Data Management:** Add, update, and manage product information (e.g., SKU, name, description, price, shelf life).
-   **Retailer Onboarding:** Approve or deny registration requests from new local retail stores.
-   **Promotions Management:** Create and broadcast promotional offers, discounts, and bundles to specific or all retail stores.
-   **System Oversight:** Monitor the health and status of all other components and workflows in the system.

### 2. **Retail Store component**
This component is the dedicated portal for local retail stores, empowering them to manage their procurement process efficiently.

**Key Features:**
-   **Product Catalog:** View a real-time catalog of Arivu Foods products, including pricing and current promotions.
-   **Order Placement:** Place new orders, track the status of existing orders (e.g., *Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered*), and view order history.

-   **Account Management:** Update store information, view invoices, and manage payment details.

### 3. **Inventory Management **
This is the core component responsible for tracking stock levels across the supply chain, from the main warehouse to individual retail stores.

**Key Features:**
-   **Real-Time Tracking:** Maintain an accurate, real-time count of product inventory at the central Arivu Foods warehouse.
-   **Low-Stock Alerts:** Automatically trigger alerts to the **distributor component** when inventory for a product falls below a predefined threshold.
-   **FEFO Logic:** Implement a "First-Expired, First-Out" policy to minimize spoilage by ensuring products with the nearest expiry dates are shipped first.
-   **Predictive Forecasting:** Analyze historical sales data and seasonal trends to predict future demand and suggest optimal stock levels.

### 4. **Order Management **
This component orchestrates the entire lifecycle of an order, from placement to fulfillment.

**Key Features:**
-   **Order Processing:** Receive new orders from **Retail Store components** and validate them.
-   **Inventory Check:** Communicate with the **Inventory Management component** to confirm stock availability. If stock is insufficient, it notifies the **distributor component**.
-   **Status Updates:** Automatically update the order status and push notifications to the relevant **Retail Store component**.
-   **Fulfillment Coordination:** Send confirmed order details to the warehouse for picking, packing, and shipping.

### 5. **Customer Management **
This component acts as a digital relationship manager for all retail store clients.

**Key Features:**

**Key Features:**
-   **Automated Invoice Generation:** Automatically generate a digital invoice as soon as an order is marked as "Shipped" by the **Order Management component**.

-   **Payment Tracking:** Monitor the payment status of all invoices and send automated reminders for upcoming or overdue payments.
-   **Integration:** Seamlessly sync all financial data with accounting software.

### 7. **Dashboard & Analytics **
This component gathers data from all other components to provide actionable insights through user-specific dashboards.

## Automated Workflow: D to Retail Store

The components work in concert to create a fully automated and efficient supply chain loop:

1.  A **Retail Store component** places an order for Arivu Foods products. The component might use smart suggestions to optimize the order quantity.
2.  The **Order Management component** receives the order, immediately checks for stock availability with the **Inventory Management component**, and confirms the order.
3.  The confirmed order is relayed to the warehouse for fulfillment. The **Inventory Management component** deducts the ordered items from the central stock.
4.  Once the warehouse ships the order, the **Order Management component** updates the status to "Shipped" and notifies the **Retail Store component**.
5.  This status change triggers the **Invoice & Billing component** to automatically generate and send an invoice to the retail store.
6.  Throughout this process, the **Dashboard & Analytics component** is continuously updated, providing both the distributor and the Retail Store with real-time insights into their respective operations.
7.  If stock levels run low at the main warehouse, the **Inventory Management component** proactively alerts the **distributor component** to reorder from suppliers, preventing future stockouts.

This component-based architecture ensures a responsive, transparent, and highly automated supply chain management system tailored to the needs of both Arivu Foods and its retail partners.
