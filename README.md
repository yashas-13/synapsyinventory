# synapsyinventory

A minimal inventory management web application built with Flask and SQLite.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

The database `inventory.db` will be created automatically on first run.
